As we know , many elders face problem of travelling and find it hard to visit doctor regularly. they usually avoid mild symptoms because they dont want to travel which in future causes severe problems.

I created a web application using HTML5, CSS3, PHP and MySQL .It solves travelling issues for elders and they can do their regular checkups and get medications from doctors online.

HTML5 AND CSS3 is Used for Frontend development of project.

PHP is used for backend to link the input data given from doctor and patient into MySQL database.

##installation:

1.First of all , you need to install XAMPP on your desktop.

2.After Installing XAMPP, start Apache and MySQL server and get the ports.

3.Then download this repo as a zip file in your device and unzip it in C/Xampp/Htdocs.

4.Open code using any IDE(VS CODE , etc).

5.Start localhost:portnumber in your browser(mine was localhost:8080).

##how it works:

1.It is basically a client and server based application.

2.Patient need to add details(firstname,lastname) , symptoms , temperature and glucose 
level(sugar).

3.The details of patient goes in patient database which can be accessed by a doctor.

4.Doctor studies their symptoms and writes medication and diet accordingly.

5.The treatment and medications given by doctor appears in front of patient.
